# SimplyPut

I just started this very silly hobby project just to try out the new Eclipse
release.

I don't really have a clue what to do with this, but there are some interesting
concepts that I would like to try to learn how to implement. Examples of such
are:

* Auto-completion, at least for literals such as { and ".
* Syntax highlighting, configurable for different languages.

Where both of the features above should be easily extendable by editing
properties files.

Two other, not-as-needed-but-certainly-cool-to-implement functions, that I
might want to look into are:

* Auto-updater (yeah!).
* Support for plugins (oh dear).
